# SAMS
This depository will serve as a place for me (and eventually the SAMS team) to store files relating to the SAMS project.

If you are a member of the SAMS team, please add your files to the appropriate folder or create an appropriate folder.

To create a new folder:
1. go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder.
2. click on New file.
3. on the text field for the file name, first write the folder name you want to create.
4. then type / , this creates a folder.
5. you can add more folders similarly.
